# RPS-Image-Classifier

![Alt text](https://github.com/ArsHelios/RPS-Image-Classifier/blob/main/RPS.jpeg)

The RPS Image Classifier project is developed to fulfill the final assignment requirement for the Dicoding class. This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build a machine learning model capable of classifying images of the Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) game gestures. The goal is to create an application that accurately predicts the user's gesture by processing images through a convolutional neural network model.

The objective is to create a robust image classification system leveraging TensorFlow and Keras that can detect and classify images into rock, paper, or scissors categories with high accuracy. The project aims to demonstrate practical applications of deep learning in computer vision tasks.

Code Features:
- Image Preprocessing and Augmentation: Enhancing model accuracy through various preprocessing techniques and data augmentation to increase the dataset's diversity.
- Convolutional Neural Network Model: Using TensorFlow and Keras to design, train, and evaluate a CNN model optimized for image classification.
- User Interface Integration: Allowing users to upload or capture images for real-time gesture classification.
- Real-Time Prediction: Providing instant predictions to users based on the uploaded or captured image.
