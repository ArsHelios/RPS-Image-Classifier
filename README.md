# RPS-Image-Classifier
RPS Image Classifier project is designed to fulfill the final requirements for Dicoding's Machine Learning for Beginner class. This project involves developing a machine learning model capable of classifying images based on the Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) game. The objective is to build an application that can accurately predict the user's gesture from the images provided. To create a functional image classification system that uses deep learning techniques to identify and classify images of rock, paper, and scissors. The classifier should be able to recognize the gestures and output the corresponding classification.
